Description: Algorithm and tools for in silico pack-TYPE transposon discovery. Filters a given genome for properties unique to DNA transposons and provides tools for the investigation of returned matches. Sequences are input in DNAString format, and ranges are returned as a dataframe (in the format returned by as.dataframe(GRanges)).
